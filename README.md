As always, use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)!

## Getting started

The following with ensure you are using the correct Node version, install the project dependencies, and run the client-side app.

```shell
nvm install
npm install
npm run client
```

After `npm run client` says it has built, run the following in a separate terminal tab or pane.

```shell
npm run server
```

Yes, the separate terminal tab setup seems annoying, but once you start writing code you will quickly forget about it. Trust me!
